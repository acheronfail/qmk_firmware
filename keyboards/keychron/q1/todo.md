# To Do!

* get a nice reactive lighting effect
* find a spot for the `end` key
  * or, alternatively figure out a nice way to add them to the keyboard
  * meta + left/right ?
* make udev rule to automatically `setxkbmap -option ctrl:swap_lalt_lctl` when a keyboard is connected
* map mouse buttons to a layer
* figure out how to create my own firmware fork and build it easily to save my changes
